> <p> Dessert: Kataifi Ekmek - often not on the menu, you have to ask for it. Semolina custard is absurdly tasty.</p>

## 2. Mason Pacific

## 3. Foreign Cinema
#### 2534 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110

## 4. Beretta
### 1199 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110
<p> Open super late, long waits at dinner time but you can walk in and get a table later in the evening. 
Great vibe - always buzzing with folks, good for a first date or to hang out late with a few friends. Pretty cheap for sf. </p>
